    title: About Me
    summary: |

        I grown up in Shaowu, Fujing Province before 18, where I was educated in Minghong Middle School during 2007-2010, Shaowu First Hight School during 2010-2013. Quiet and comfortable 
        life in this small city help me develop an optimistic and easy-going personality. At the sametime, plenty of time allowed me get involved in various activities including sports, speeches,
        video games and so on. I think these memories would constantly motivate me in different stages of my life.
        
        I was admitted to Beijing University of Astronautics and Aeronautics (BUAA) in 2013 and obtained B.S. degree in engineering in 2017, along with B.A. degree in English language. 
        Currently I am a Ph.D. student in Image Processing Center, School of Astronautics, BUAA. My research interest include image segmentation and restoration.
